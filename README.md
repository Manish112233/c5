# DC Motor Speed Measurement using ATmega16

## 📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates a **DC Motor Speed Measurement System** using the **ATmega16 microcontroller**.  
The motor speed is controlled using **PWM**, and the actual motor speed is measured using an **incremental encoder**.  
The calculated **RPM (Revolutions Per Minute)** is displayed in real time on a **16×2 LCD**.

This project focuses on **core embedded systems concepts** such as timers, interrupts, PWM, and motor driver interfacing.

## 🧠 Working Principle
1. The DC motor is driven using **PWM generated by Timer1**.
2. The motor encoder generates pulses proportional to the motor speed.
3. Encoder pulses are counted using **External Interrupt (INT0)**.
4. **Timer0** creates a precise 1-second measurement window.
5. RPM is calculated using the formula:

RPM = (Pulses per second × 60) / Pulses Per Revolution (PPR)
6. The calculated RPM is displayed on the LCD in real time.
